Dr. Nattapol earned his Ph.D. in Plant Pathology with a focus on Mycology from the University of Florida in 2022, followed by a postdoctoral fellowship at the university's Emerging Pathogens Institute. Currently, he is a lecturer in the Department of Biological Sciences at Muban Chombueng Rajabhat University. Dr. Nattapol’s research centers on the taxonomy, systematics, and evolution of macrofungi, with a growing emphasis on the evolutionary dynamics of filamentous fungal pathogens. His work seeks to unravel fundamental questions about how saprotrophic fungi evolve into human pathogens, providing critical insights into the mechanisms of pathogenicity. Beyond his research, Dr. Nattapol is a passionate educator, teaching courses in biodiversity and agricultural microbiology. He is deeply committed to mentoring undergraduate and graduate students, equipping them with the skills and knowledge needed for careers in science and medicine.
