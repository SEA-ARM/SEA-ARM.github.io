MICROBIOLOGY RESEARCHER - SYAHRIAR NUR MAULANA MALIK IBRAHIM, M.Sc. / Pref. name: NIAR IBRAHIM ROSE 

Niar Ibrahim Rose (Syahriar Nur Maulana Malik Ibrahim) is a Ph.D. student under supervisor Dr. Nuttapon Pombubpa. She got bachelor’s degree in biology at Airlangga University (Indonesia) and a master’s degree in biotechnology at Chulalongkorn University. She is interested in microbial (fungi and bacteria) exploration by polyphasic identification (physiology, morphology, ecology, and genetics), their utilization of environment and industry, and their interaction in animals, plants and environments approach by omics. As an environmental microbiologist dedicated to understanding fungal pathogen interactions, she has spent nearly a decade advancing knowledge in this field. Currently, she works at the Nat Pombubpa Lab, Department of Microbiology, Chulalongkorn University, focusing on detecting pathogenic fungi and bacteria reservoirs using metagenomic processes and analysis tools like HPCC and R Studio. Her expertise includes microbial isolation and applications in bio-products such as hydrolase enzymes, biosurfactants, and oligosaccharides.
