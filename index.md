# SEA-ARMi's Website


The South East Asia Antifungal Resistance Monitoring Initiative (SEA-ARMi) is a collaborative research effort focused on understanding and addressing antifungal resistance across Southeast Asia. <br>
This initiative aims to:<br>
* Monitor Antifungal Resistance: Conduct surveillance to identify patterns and prevalence of resistance in fungal pathogens affecting human, animal, and environmental health.
* Strengthen Regional Collaboration: Foster partnerships among researchers, clinicians, and laboratories in the region to share data, methodologies, and expertise.
* Enhance Treatment Outcomes: Provide insights into resistance mechanisms to inform treatment strategies and improve patient care.
* Support Public Health Efforts: Contribute to global efforts in managing fungal diseases and minimizing the impact of antifungal resistance, which is an emerging public health concern.
<br>This initiative reflects a proactive approach to tackling a significant challenge in medical mycology by leveraging regional cooperation and scientific innovation.
