  description: The MRC Centre for Medical Mycology (MRC CMM) aims to deliver world-leading research that will substantially advance our understanding of fungal pathogenesis, host immunity and disease phenotypes, thereby enabling the generation and utilisation of skills and knowledge that will improve the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of fungal diseases in the future. Amongst the CMM activities that are actively working to increase capacity in medical mycology, the FAILSAFE project aims to provide combined global research and development (R&D), One Health and educational activities that will reduce the fungal disease burden in low and middle income countries (LMICs).
