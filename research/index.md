Soil is home to many microorganisms, especially fungi, which play crucial roles in the environment. These fungi can infect plants and animals and can also be harmful to humans if their spores are inhaled or come into contact with the skin. In 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) identified several pathogenic fungi, some of which have been found in Thailand’s agricultural areas.

Studies have shown that fungi from the WHO FPPL list, including Mucorales and Eumycetoma agents, are common in these soils. These fungi have caused significant infections in humans in Bangkok and other regions over the years. However, there is a significant gap in our understanding of these fungal reservoirs and their antifungal resistance properties.

The problem of antifungal drug resistance is increasing, with major drug classes like azoles, echinocandins, and polyenes becoming less effective. Several specific genes have been identified that contribute to this resistance. Understanding these genetic factors is essential for developing better treatments and reducing the impact of these fungal infections.However, the genetic mechanisms by which these fungi infect humans and the differences in these genes across different regions, especially in Southeast Asia, are not well understood. Establishing a Southeast Asian (SEA) network to pool resources and share expertise and knowledge on these fungal pathogens will immediately enhance our ability to address fungal drug-resistant strains and infections, specifically for SEA strains, thereby strengthening agricultural biosecurity.

By using advanced genomic technologies, we will analyse the genomes of these fungi to identify important genetic markers related to their ability to cause disease and resist treatment. This research will improve our ability to detect and manage these fungi, benefiting food security and sustainable agricultural practices in Southeast Asia.

Our immediate aim is to assemble a group of mycologists from Southeast Asia especially LMICs to form this network and begin to collect and analyse regional fungal pathogens. Our immediate objective is to collect fungi from soil samples, extract their genomic DNA, and compile a comprehensive genome database of these pathogenic fungi from Southeast Asia.

This project will have a significant impact by enhancing the detection and management of drug-resistant fungal strains, improving clinical treatment options, and strengthening agricultural biosecurity. By fostering international collaboration and utilizing genomic technologies, we aim to tackle the urgent issues of fungal infections and antifungal resistance, ultimately improving food security and public health in Southeast Asia.

In summary, our overall objectives include establishing a biobank of pathogenic fungi from Southeast Asia, profiling their genomes to develop comprehensive datasets, and building a network of experts to sustain these activities and support the consortium’s long-term goals. This initiative will empower Southeast Asian countries to combat the spread of these infections, ultimately improving one-health solutions for animals, the environment, and humans. The immediate availability of this biobank and genomic data will directly influence decision-making by providing health professionals and agricultural experts with the necessary tools to identify and respond to fungal threats swiftly and accurately. This resource will enable the development of targeted treatments and management strategies, enhancing biosecurity and public health responses. Furthermore, the biobank will lay the groundwork for long-term international networks to address antifungal resistance in human pathogens and their environmental reservoirs in high endemic areas.

The lessons learned and outcomes achieved will also benefit other countries where these pathogens impact food security and human health.
