# WHO FPPL
The [WHO Fungal Priority Pathogens List (FPPL)](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240060241) is a global initiative that addresses the urgent need for research and development (R&D) on fungal pathogens, aiming to guide the international response to fungal infections and antifungal resistance. The list categorizes pathogens into three priority levels: critical, high, and medium, focusing on key strategies such as strengthening laboratory capacity, ensuring sustained investment in R&D, and improving public health policies to prevent resistance (Figure 1).

In Thailand, fungal pathogens like Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Talaromyces marneffei have been reported in hospitals, with non-albicans Candida species like Candida tropicalis and Candida glabrata also prevalent. Despite the presence of certain pathogens in clinical settings, many others, such as Acremonium spp., Fusarium spp., and Mucor spp., remain under-monitored.
The lack of comprehensive environmental surveys in Southeast Asia complicates the understanding of fungal pathogen reservoirs, especially in tropical habitats. The GlobalFungi database shows limited surveys in Thailand, highlighting the need for focused environmental studies. Moreover, there is a general absence of WHO FPPL data across the region, pointing to significant gaps in fungal pathogen monitoring (Table 1).

## Filamentous WHO-FPPL
Filamentous fungi are a group of fungi characterized by the presence of long, thread-like structures called hyphae. These hyphae grow in a branching, network-like formation called a mycelium, which is the vegetative part of the fungus. Filamentous fungi are responsible for a wide range of environmental processes, including decomposition, and can also cause various infections in humans, especially in immunocompromised individuals.

### Key Characteristics:
* Hyphal Structure: Hyphae are long, thin filaments that spread across surfaces and grow by extending at their tips.
* Mycelium: A mass of hyphae forms the mycelium, which can infiltrate substrates, allowing the fungus to absorb nutrients.
* Reproduction: These fungi can reproduce both sexually and asexually, with spore production being common, which allows them to spread and colonize new environments.
Common examples of filamentous fungi include species from genera such as Aspergillus, Fusarium, Penicillium, and Mucor, which can have significant medical, environmental, and industrial relevance.
These fungi can thrive in various environments, including soil, decaying organic matter, and indoor spaces, where they may pose health risks when inhaled, particularly to those with weakened immune systems.
