###WHO FPPL
The [WHO Fungal Priority Pathogens List (FPPL)](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240060241) is a global initiative that addresses the urgent need for research and development (R&D) on fungal pathogens, aiming to guide the international response to fungal infections and antifungal resistance. The list categorizes pathogens into three priority levels: critical, high, and medium, focusing on key strategies such as strengthening laboratory capacity, ensuring sustained investment in R&D, and improving public health policies to prevent resistance (Figure 1).

In Thailand, fungal pathogens like Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Talaromyces marneffei have been reported in hospitals, with non-albicans Candida species like Candida tropicalis and Candida glabrata also prevalent. Despite the presence of certain pathogens in clinical settings, many others, such as Acremonium spp., Fusarium spp., and Mucor spp., remain under-monitored.
The lack of comprehensive environmental surveys in Southeast Asia complicates the understanding of fungal pathogen reservoirs, especially in tropical habitats. The GlobalFungi database shows limited surveys in Thailand, highlighting the need for focused environmental studies. Moreover, there is a general absence of WHO FPPL data across the region, pointing to significant gaps in fungal pathogen monitoring (Table 1).
