###WHO FPPL
The [WHO Fungal Priority Pathogens List (FPPL)](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240060241) is a global initiative that addresses the urgent need for research and development (R&D) on fungal pathogens, aiming to guide the international response to fungal infections and antifungal resistance. The list categorizes pathogens into three priority levels: critical, high, and medium, focusing on key strategies such as strengthening laboratory capacity, ensuring sustained investment in R&D, and improving public health policies to prevent resistance (Figure 1).
